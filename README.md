# Person Service Spring Boot Project

This repository is a template for creating new Spring Boot projects with a pre-configured set of essential dependencies and features. It is designed to help you quickly bootstrap robust, production-ready applications.

## Project Information

- **Group:** `com.quetoquenana`
- **Artifact:** `user-service`
- **Name:** `User Service`
- **Description:** User Service Spring Boot project
- **Package name:** `com.quetoquenana.template`

## Included Dependencies

This template includes the following dependencies by default (as listed in `pom.xml`):

- **Spring Boot Actuator** (`spring-boot-starter-actuator`): Monitoring and management endpoints.
- **Spring Data JPA** (`spring-boot-starter-data-jpa`): Simplifies data access and ORM with JPA.
- **Spring Security** (`spring-boot-starter-security`): Authentication and authorization capabilities.
- **Spring Web** (`spring-boot-starter-web`): Build RESTful web services and web applications.
- **Spring Boot Test** (`spring-boot-starter-test`, test scope): Testing support for Spring Boot applications.
- **Testcontainers** (`testcontainers`, test scope): Containerized integration testing with real databases (PostgreSQL).
- **Spring HATEOAS** (`spring-boot-starter-hateoas`): Hypermedia-driven REST APIs.
- **Flyway Core** (`flyway-core`): Database schema migrations.
- **Flyway PostgreSQL Database Support** (`flyway-database-postgresql`): Flyway support for PostgreSQL.
- **Spring Boot DevTools** (`spring-boot-devtools`, runtime, optional): Rapid development and automatic restarts.
- **Spring Boot Docker Compose** (`spring-boot-docker-compose`, runtime, optional): Run dependent services with Docker Compose.
- **PostgreSQL Driver** (`postgresql`, runtime): Connects to PostgreSQL databases.
- **Lombok** (`lombok`, optional): Simplifies Java code with annotations for boilerplate reduction.
- **Spring Security Test** (`spring-security-test`, test scope): Testing support for Spring Security.
- **Spring Boot Validation** (`spring-boot-starter-validation`): Validation support for DTOs and request payloads.

## Security Configuration

This template uses Spring Security with the following configuration:

- **HTTP Basic Authentication** is enabled for all endpoints except `GET /api/executions`, which is public.
- **User Details:**
  - Username: `user`
  - Password: `password` (BCrypt encoded)
  - Role: `SYSTEM`
- **Access Rules:**
  - `GET /api/executions`: Public (no authentication required)
  - All other endpoints: Require authentication and the `SYSTEM` role
- **Configuration Location:** See `src/main/java/com/quetoquenana/template/config/SecurityConfig.java` for details.

## Example Feature: Execution Tracking Table

This template includes a complete example of tracking application executions:

- **Database Table:** Automatically created using Flyway migrations (`executions` table).
- **Model:** Java entity for executions, using @JsonView for API responses.
- **Repository:** Spring Data JPA repository for CRUD operations.
- **Service:** Business logic for saving and retrieving executions, including paginated queries.
- **Controller:** REST API to view executions (`/api/executions`), with endpoints for list, detail, and paginated results. The app uses the artifactId as context path, so the full path is `/template/api/executions`.
- **Startup Logic:** Records a new execution each time the app starts.
- **Unit Tests:** Comprehensive test cases for the controller and service, including JsonView and pagination.
- **Postman Collection:** Example requests to test the API, stored in the `.postman` folder.

## Internationalization (i18n) Support

This template is ready for multi-language support using Spring Boot's internationalization features:

- **Message Resource Files:**
  - `src/main/resources/messages.properties` (default, English)
  - `src/main/resources/messages_es.properties` (Spanish)
- **Configuration:**
  - See `src/main/java/com/quetoquenana/template/config/I18nConfig.java` for MessageSource and LocaleResolver beans.
- **Usage:**
  - Inject `MessageSource` into your services or controllers and use `messageSource.getMessage("welcome.message", null, locale)` to retrieve localized messages.
  - The default locale is English; you can switch locales using the `SessionLocaleResolver` or by customizing locale resolution.
  - Rest controllers use the `Accept-Language` header to set the locale.
- **Adding More Languages:**
  - Create additional files like `messages_fr.properties` for French, etc.

Example usage in a service/controller:

```java
@Autowired
private MessageSource messageSource;

public String getWelcomeMessage(Locale locale) {
    return messageSource.getMessage("welcome.message", null, locale);
}
```

## Testing

This project includes both unit and integration tests:

- **Unit Tests:** Fast tests that mock dependencies and verify business logic in isolation.
- **Integration Tests:** Use [Testcontainers](https://www.testcontainers.org/) to spin up real PostgreSQL containers for end-to-end testing of the application, including database interactions and REST endpoints.
- **Test Structure:**
  - Unit tests are located in `src/test/java/com/quetoquenana/userservice/controller/` and other relevant packages.
  - Integration tests use `@SpringBootTest` or `@Testcontainers` and are named with the `IT` suffix (e.g., `PersonControllerIT`).

To run all tests:

```bash
./mvnw test
```

Testcontainers will automatically start and stop containers as needed during integration tests.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone this repository** and update the project information as needed.
2. **Configure your database** in the properties files (`application-dev.properties`, `application-prd.properties`).
3. **Run the application:**

   ```bash
   ./mvnw spring-boot:run
   ```

4. **Access the API:**

   - List executions: `GET /api/executions` (public)
   - Get execution by ID: `GET /api/executions/{id}` (requires authentication)
   - Paginated executions: `GET /api/executions/page?page=0&size=10` (requires authentication)
   - Monitor API: `GET /actuator/health` (requires authentication)

5. **Test with Postman:**
   - Import the collection from the `postman/collections` folder and run example requests.

## Customization

- Update the `pom.xml` to add or remove dependencies as needed.
- Modify the package structure and application properties to fit your requirements.
- Extend the execution tracking feature or add new features as needed.

## Use of DTOs for API Requests

This project uses Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) to handle incoming API requests. Instead of exposing or accepting entity/model classes directly in controller endpoints, dedicated DTO classes are used for create and update operations (e.g., `PersonCreateRequest`, `PersonUpdateRequest`, `ProfileCreateRequest`, `ProfileUpdateRequest`, etc.).

**Benefits:**
- Only the intended fields are exposed and accepted from clients, improving security.
- Validation annotations (such as `@NotNull`, `@NotBlank`) are applied directly to DTO fields for robust input validation.
- The service layer is updated to accept these DTOs, and conversion logic is handled in the model or service classes.

**Example:**
When creating or updating a person or profile, the API expects a DTO payload rather than the full entity object. This ensures only updatable fields are processed and sensitive/internal fields are not exposed.
